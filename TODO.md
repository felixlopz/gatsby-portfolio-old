<!-- Gatsby portfolio -->
Personal Portfolio, I wanted something simple good for seo and that would load fast and look attractive, I decided to use gatsby for the development of this project because it gave me all the features I was looking for, the projects are managed using contentful, so I can easily modify them to my whim.

<!-- Kayak tours -->
I wanted to design and develop as a kind of home page for a company and this was the result, Kayak tours simulates a company that offers kayak tours around the world. It is completely responsive and has a functional contact form.
